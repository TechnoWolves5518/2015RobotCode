# 2015RobotCode

<a href="http://www.technowolves.org/">Techno Wolves Website</a>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p> The project <i>RobotDemo</i> is the command-subsystem/function based code that is a model of the code which is used in our final robot for competition. It uses a custom class which offers a highly simple approach (in my opinion) than the original command-based approach.</p>

<p>This repository contains code to control our robot using the WPILIB libraries for the 2015 FRC Season, Recycle Rush. The project <i>JoystickDemo</i> extends the SampleRobot base class. The SampleRobot base clas offers basic functioning and handling with a manual implementation of periodic functions using a while loop. The project <i>JoystickDemo2</i> uses the Command-based approach with various commands depending on different subsystems. This project extends the IterativeRobot base class which uses an init and a periodic function for each mode (autonomous, teleop, test).</p>
